            <h2>1. Representations and Warranties</h2>
            <p>
                This Site is available to users who are at least 18 years of age. If you are between 13 and 18, you may only use the Site with parental permission. Users under 13 are prohibited from using the Site or Singture services.

            <h2>2. Singers / Sellers</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Basics</h3>
            <p>
                Singers create profiles on Singture to offer audio services to Buyers. They may provide Custom Offers in addition to their standard services. For each audio service sold and successfully completed, Singers earn 80% of the purchase amount. For hourly contracts, Singers receive 80% of the hourly rate for the hours worked. Singture credits Singers once an order is completed, as detailed in the "Orders" section.
            </p>
            <p>
                Singers are prohibited from promoting their services via Google Ads. Ratings for Singers are based on Buyer reviews, which can impact account status. Singers must secure general liability insurance to cover risks associated with their services.
            </p>

            <h3>2.7 Shipping Physical Deliverables</h3>
            <p>
                If a service involves physical deliverables (e.g., albums), Singers must define shipping costs and Buyers must provide a shipping address. Singture does not guarantee the quality or timeliness of shipping and is not liable for any issues related to delivery.
            </p>

            <h2>3. User Conduct and Protection</h2>
            <p>
                Singture fosters a friendly, professional community. Users are expected to adhere to these guidelines while engaging on the platform.
            </p>

            <h3>3.1 Basics</h3>
            <p>
                Users may not exchange personal contact details to circumvent Singture's messaging system. All necessary information should be exchanged within the Order Page. Users are responsible for maintaining respectful communication and must refrain from abusive or threatening language.
            </p>

            <h3>3.2 Reporting Violations</h3>
            <p>
                Users should report any violations or misconduct to our Customer Support team. Our Trust & Safety team will review reports confidentially.
            </p>

            <h3>3.3 Disputes and Cancellations</h3>
            <p>
                We encourage users to resolve conflicts amicably. If disputes persist, users can contact Customer Support for assistance. For more details on order cancellations and refunds, please refer to the Payment Terms.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Non-Permitted Usage</h2>
            <p>
                Singture does not allow adult services or any form of harassment. Communication must remain professional and constructive, and users may not create false identities or misrepresent themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users are limited to one active Singture account to prevent fraud and abuse. Violations may result in suspension or permanent removal from the platform.
            </p>

            <h3>4.1 Intellectual Property Claims</h3>
            <p>
                Singture takes copyright and trademark infringement seriously. Users should ensure their content is original or properly licensed. Clear procedures for reporting violations are in place.
            </p>

            <h3>4.2 Fraud / Unlawful Use</h3>
            <p>
                Users must not engage in illegal activities, including circumventing sanctions. Violations can lead to immediate account suspension.
